The predicted goal, however, only mentions moving the robot within SA1, without any reference to block B1 or what should be done with it.\n\nThe predicted goal is missing the critical component of interacting with block B1, which is a key part of the ground truth goals. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal would not achieve the real goal because it does not include the action of releasing B1 in SA1.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
