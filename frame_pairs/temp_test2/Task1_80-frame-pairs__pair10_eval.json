The predicted goal states to move B1 to the top of the arena, which is less specific about the exact location within the top area.\n\nThe predicted goal is less specific because it does not mention the \"left corner\" but only the \"top\" of the arena. This could potentially lead to different outcomes, as placing B1 anywhere along the top edge would satisfy the predicted goal but not necessarily the ground truth goal.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals. The predicted goal lacks the specificity of placing B1 in the top left corner.",
