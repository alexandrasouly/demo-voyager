The predicted goal only mentions picking up B3, without specifying where to move it afterward.\n\nThe predicted goal is incomplete because it does not tell the agent what to do with B3 after picking it up. Therefore, an agent that only tries to achieve the predicted goal might pick up B3 but fail to achieve the real goal since it does not include the crucial step of moving B3 to SA1.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
