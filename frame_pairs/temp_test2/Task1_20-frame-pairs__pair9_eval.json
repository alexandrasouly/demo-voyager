The predicted goal, however, states to \"Maintain current position with block B1,\" which implies that the agent should not move from its current position while holding block B1.\n\nThe predicted goal does not match the ground truth goals because it does not involve moving to the top left corner or releasing the block. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal would not achieve the real goal as described in the ground truths.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
