The predicted goal does not specify the color or shape of B4, but since there is only one B4 mentioned in both the ground truths and the predicted goal, this omission does not lead to a different outcome.\n\nThe predicted goal is therefore correct as it would lead the agent to achieve the true goal, despite the differences in phrasing.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
