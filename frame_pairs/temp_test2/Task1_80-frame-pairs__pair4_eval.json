The predicted goal also specifies that block B1 should be moved to the top left of the arena, which is consistent with the ground truth goals. The additional instruction in the predicted goal to move R (the robot) to the top center is not in conflict with the ground truth goals, as it does not prevent the main task of moving block B1 to the top left corner from being achieved. Therefore, the predicted goal is correct because it would lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals. The similarity level is (2) Correct.",
