Despite differences in phrasing, such as \"toss,\" \"push,\" \"move,\" and \"place,\" all descriptions lead to the same outcome: B4 ending up in SA1. There is no mention of the necessity to move B2 in the predicted goal, but since it is not consistent across all ground truth descriptions, it is not considered essential to the main goal.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is (2) Correct, as an agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
