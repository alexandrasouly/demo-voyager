The predicted goal states \"Move B1 to SA1,\" which aligns with the outcome described in all the ground truth goals. The predicted goal does not specify the color of B1 or SA1, but since all ground truth descriptions refer to the same objects, the predicted goal is assumed to be referring to the same blue circle B1 and the same special area SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal is less detailed than the ground truth goals, but it conveys the essential action required to achieve the same outcome. Therefore, the predicted goal is correct as it would lead the agent to achieve the true goal described in the ground truth observations. The level of similarity is (2) Correct.",
