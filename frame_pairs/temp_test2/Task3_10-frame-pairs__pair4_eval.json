    "cot": "The ground truth goals all describe actions that involve the robot approaching and manipulating a specific block, B1. They all involve moving towards the block and repositioning it in some manner, although the exact actions vary slightly (approaching, picking up, turning, driving down, and pushing).\n\nThe predicted goal, on the other hand, specifies moving block B1 towards a goal region labeled SA1. This goal introduces a new element, SA1, which was not mentioned in the ground truth goals. The ground truth goals do not specify a final location or direction for block B1, only that it should be approached and manipulated.\n\nGiven that the predicted goal includes a specific target location (SA1) that is not mentioned in any of the ground truth goals, the predicted goal could lead to a different outcome than what is described in the ground truths. Therefore, the predicted goal is not guaranteed to achieve the same result as the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
