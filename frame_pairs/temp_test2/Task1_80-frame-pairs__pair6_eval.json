The predicted goal, however, only states \"Move R to B1,\" which implies that the robot should move to the location of block B1 but does not specify what should be done with the block once the robot reaches it.\n\nThe predicted goal does not contain enough information to ensure that the robot will achieve the true goal of moving block B1 to the top left corner. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal would not necessarily succeed in achieving the real goal.\n\nThe similarity level between the ground truth goals and the predicted goal is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
