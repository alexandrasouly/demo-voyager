The predicted goal specifies moving blocks B1 and B2 to SA3, which aligns with the first and third ground truth goals that mention moving blocks into SA3. The second ground truth goal involves moving blocks into SA2, which is not mentioned in the predicted goal, but since the predicted goal does not contradict this (it does not specify not to move blocks into SA2), it is not necessarily incorrect. The fourth ground truth goal mentions moving triangles, but without knowing if B1 and B2 are triangles, we cannot determine the correctness based on this statement alone.\n\nGiven that the predicted goal aligns with moving B1 and B2 into SA3, which is part of the ground truth goals, the predicted goal is correct as it would lead to a subset of the true goal being achieved. The predicted goal does not provide information about the other blocks or returning the robot to its original position, but it does not contradict the ground truth goals either.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is (2) Correct.",
