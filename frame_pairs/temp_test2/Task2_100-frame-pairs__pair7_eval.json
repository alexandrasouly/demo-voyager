    "cot": "The ground truth goals all specify that two blocks, B1 and B4, need to be moved inside special area SA1. The predicted goal, however, only mentions moving block B1 to SA1 and does not mention block B4 at all. Additionally, the predicted goal includes an extra instruction to move R (the robot) to the bottom center of the arena, which is not a required part of the ground truth goals, although one of the ground truth descriptions does mention going down to the bottom/middle of the arena after pushing B1 and B4 into SA1.\n\nSince the predicted goal omits the action on block B4, which is a necessary part of the ground truth goals, the predicted goal is not sufficient for an agent to achieve the real goal. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
