The predicted goal specifies moving B2 to SA3 and placing it on top of B1, which implies that B1 is already in SA3 or will be there as well.\n\nHowever, the ground truth goals do not specify that B2 needs to be on top of B1, just that both need to be inside SA3. The predicted goal adds a condition (B2 on top of B1) that is not present in the ground truth goals. This additional condition changes the outcome, as the agent would be trying to stack the blocks rather than just ensuring they are both in the specified area.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
