Despite differences in phrasing, all descriptions lead to the same outcome: block B4 ending up in SA1.\n\nHowever, one of the ground truth goals also mentions pushing B2 down and to the right, which is not included in the predicted goal. This additional action does not affect the main objective of moving B4 to SA1, but it is an extra step that is not captured by the predicted goal.\n\nSince the main objective of moving B4 to SA1 is present in both the ground truth goals and the predicted goal, the predicted goal is correct in terms of achieving the primary outcome. The additional action involving B2 is not required for the main objective to be considered complete.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal, as the main action involving B4 and SA1 is consistent across all descriptions.",
