The actions described are to grab, move to and pick up, grasp, and pick up the block. The predicted goal is to \"Pick up B1.\"\n\nThe predicted goal matches the action described in all the ground truth goals, which is to pick up block B1. There is no mention of the color or shape of the block in the predicted goal, but since all ground truth descriptions refer to the same block B1, the lack of this detail in the predicted goal does not change the outcome.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals. The similarity level is (2) Correct.",
