The predicted goal does not mention the color of B3, but since all ground truth descriptions refer to the same block B3, we can infer that the color is not essential for this particular goal. The predicted goal does not include the additional actions involving B5 and B4 mentioned in the ground truth goals, but these actions are not necessary for achieving the main objective of moving B3 to SA1.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is correct because an agent that tries to achieve it will succeed in achieving the real goal of moving B3 to SA1. The additional actions with other blocks do not affect the success of the main goal stated in the prediction. The similarity level is (2) Correct.",
