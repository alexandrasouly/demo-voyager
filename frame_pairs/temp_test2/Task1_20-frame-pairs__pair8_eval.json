    "cot": "The ground truth goals describe a sequence where the robot moves away from a yellow triangle block labeled B1, places B1 in the top left corner, then moves back to the center of the arena, and finally moves away from B1.\n\nThe predicted goal instructs the robot to move from the top left to the center left of the arena and release B1 at the top left.\n\nBoth the ground truth and the predicted goal involve moving B1 to the top left corner and then moving the robot away from B1. However, the predicted goal specifies moving the robot to the center left of the arena after releasing B1, which is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth goals. The ground truth goals mention moving back into the center of the arena and moving away from B1, which could be interpreted as moving to the center left, but this is not certain without additional context.\n\nGiven the information provided, the predicted goal seems to align with the ground truth goals in terms of the final position of B1 and the robot moving away from B1. The slight difference in the robot's final position (center left vs. center) does not appear to meaningfully alter the outcome of the goal.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal, even if there are slight differences in phrasing that do not affect the meaning of the goal.",
