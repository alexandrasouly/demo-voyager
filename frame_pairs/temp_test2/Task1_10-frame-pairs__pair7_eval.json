The predicted goal, however, states to \"Maintain current position with B1,\" which implies that block B1 should not be moved from its starting position.\n\nSince the predicted goal is directing the agent to do the opposite of what the ground truth goals are stating (to move B1 versus to not move B1), the predicted goal is incorrect. The agent following the predicted goal would fail to achieve the real goal as described in the ground truth.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
