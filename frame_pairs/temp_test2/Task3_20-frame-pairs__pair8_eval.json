The predicted goal also mentions moving B2 to SA1, but it includes moving R (the robot) to SA1 as well. Since all the ground truth goals imply that the robot must move B2 to SA1, which inherently involves the robot moving to SA1 to perform the action, the predicted goal is essentially instructing the same outcome. The predicted goal is correct because it tells the agent enough information to achieve the true goal, which is to place block B2 in special area SA1.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
