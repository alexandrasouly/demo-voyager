However, there is a discrepancy in the ground truths regarding the shape of B5 (square block or ball) and an additional action (pushing blocks outside SA1 to the left a bit) mentioned in one of the ground truths.\n\nThe predicted goal states \"Move B5 to SA1,\" which aligns with the core objective of all the ground truth goals: getting B5 into SA1. The predicted goal does not specify the shape of B5 or any additional actions with other blocks.\n\nGiven that the predicted goal matches the primary action of moving B5 to SA1, which is common across all ground truth descriptions, the predicted goal is correct. It tells the agent enough information to achieve the true goal (moving B5 to SA1) without additional unnecessary details. The discrepancy in the shape of B5 and the additional action mentioned in one ground truth do not affect the primary outcome of the predicted goal.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
