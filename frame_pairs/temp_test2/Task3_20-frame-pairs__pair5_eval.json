The predicted goal states \"Move B1 to SA3,\" which aligns with the outcome described in all the ground truth goals. There is no mention of additional actions such as moving the robot back to its original position, but this does not affect the outcome of placing B1 in SA3.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
