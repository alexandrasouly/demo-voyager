    "cot": "The ground truth goals all specify that two objects, B1 and B2, need to be moved into a special area labeled SA1. They also mention the shape (circle) and color (green) of B1 and B2 in some descriptions, but these details are not present in the predicted goal. However, since all ground truth descriptions agree on the action and the objects involved, the lack of these details in the predicted goal does not change the outcome.\n\nThe ground truth goals also mention B3 in one instance, specifying an additional action for this block (\"Push B1 and B2 into SA1, and B3 down to the bottom\"). However, since this action is not included in the other ground truth descriptions, it is not considered essential to the main goal of moving B1 and B2 into SA1.\n\nGiven that the predicted goal involves moving B1 and B2 into SA1, which aligns with the core objective of all the ground truth goals, the predicted goal is correct. It provides enough information for an agent to achieve the true goal, which is to move B1 and B2 into SA1.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
