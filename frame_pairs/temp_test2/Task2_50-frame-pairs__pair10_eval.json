They also mention block B4 in the context of being moved to or into SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal, however, states that block B5 should be placed in SA2, which is a different special area than SA1. Additionally, it mentions moving B4 and the robot to the center left, which is not part of the ground truth goals.\n\nGiven this information, the predicted goal is directing the agent to achieve a different outcome than the ground truth goals. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
