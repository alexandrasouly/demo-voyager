The predicted goal, however, states a subgoal of maintaining the current position and holding B1, which does not involve moving B1 to the top left corner.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is incorrect because an agent following it would not achieve the real goal of moving B1 to the top left corner. The agent would instead stay in place while holding B1, which is a different outcome.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
