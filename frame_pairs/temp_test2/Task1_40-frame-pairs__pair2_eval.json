The predicted goal instructs the robot (R) to move to the top left while carrying B1. This implies that B1 will end up in the top left corner as a result of the robot's movement, which aligns with the outcome described in the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is (2) Correct, as an agent following this instruction would succeed in achieving the real goal.",
