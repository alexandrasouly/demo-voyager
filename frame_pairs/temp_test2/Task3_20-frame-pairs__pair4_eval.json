The predicted goal states \"Move B1 to SA2,\" which aligns with the outcome described in the ground truth goals. The predicted goal does not specify the color or shape of B1, but since all ground truth descriptions refer to the same block B1, the lack of this detail in the predicted goal does not change the required outcome.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
