The predicted goal only states \"Pick up B1\" without specifying where to move it after picking it up.\n\nThe predicted goal is incomplete because it does not contain information about the final location of block B1, which is a significant part of the ground truth goals. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal would not necessarily achieve the real goal, as it would not know to move B1 to the top left after picking it up.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
