The predicted goal only mentions picking up B1, without specifying where to move it afterward.\n\nThe predicted goal is incomplete because it does not include the final destination of the block, which is a crucial part of the ground truth goals. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal would not necessarily achieve the real goal, as it would not have the information needed to move B1 to the correct location.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
