The predicted goal states to move B1 to the top of the arena, which is less specific about the exact location within the top area of the arena.\n\nThe predicted goal is less specific than the ground truth goals, as it does not mention the \"left corner\" but only the \"top\" of the arena. This could potentially lead to different outcomes, as the top of the arena could be interpreted as anywhere along the upper edge, not necessarily the top left corner.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal might not succeed in achieving the real goal because the predicted goal lacks the specificity of the top left corner, leading to a meaningful difference in the outcome.",
