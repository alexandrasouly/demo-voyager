    "cot": "The ground truth goals all specify that block B2, which is a green circle block, should be moved into the pink special area SA2. The predicted goal states \"Move B2 to SA2,\" which aligns with the outcome described in the ground truth goals. The predicted goal does not specify the color or shape of B2 or the color of SA2, but since all ground truth goals refer to the same block and special area, the predicted goal is assumed to refer to the same entities.\n\nThe predicted goal is less specific about the method of moving B2 (e.g., \"pick up,\" \"push,\" \"move to the top and pick up\"), but the end result is the same: B2 ends up in SA2. The predicted goal tells the agent enough information to achieve the true goal, which is to have B2 in SA2, without any extraneous details.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is (2) Correct. An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
