The predicted goal only mentions picking up B3 from SA3, but does not specify what to do with it after picking it up. \n\nThe predicted goal is a subtask of the ground truth goals, but it does not encompass the entire goal, as it omits the crucial step of placing B3 into SA1. Therefore, an agent that only tries to achieve the predicted goal will not succeed in achieving the real goal because it does not include the final placement of the block into the correct location.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
