Picking up a block may not be equivalent to moving it towards a specific area, especially if the robot is not designed to pick up blocks but only to push them. Additionally, the predicted goal does not specify a target location for the block.\n\nGiven this information, the predicted goal is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because picking up a block does not necessarily result in moving it towards SA1, which is the specified target in the ground truth goals.",
