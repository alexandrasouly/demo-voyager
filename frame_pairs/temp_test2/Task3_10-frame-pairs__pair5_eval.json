The predicted goal contains all the necessary information for an agent to achieve the real goal: the block to move (B1) and the target location (SA3). The additional details in the ground truth goals (like the color of the block or the special area) are not necessary for the completion of the goal since the labels B1 and SA3 are unique identifiers.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
