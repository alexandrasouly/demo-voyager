The predicted goal states \"Move B4 to SA1,\" which aligns with the outcome described in all the ground truth goals. The predicted goal does not specify the color or shape of B4, but since all ground truth descriptions refer to the same block B4, these details are not necessary for the agent to achieve the goal. The predicted goal also does not mention the action to be taken with B2, but since B2 is not the primary focus of the goal and the main objective is to move B4 to SA1, this omission does not change the outcome.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is (2) Correct, as an agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
