The predicted goal also mentions moving B1 to the top left of the arena, but it includes \"Move R and B1,\" which suggests that the robot (R) and the block (B1) should be moved together to the top left.\n\nSince the ground truth goals do not specify the position of the robot after moving block B1, only the position of the block itself, the predicted goal adds an additional requirement that is not present in the ground truth goals. This could potentially lead to a different outcome if the position of the robot itself is relevant to the success of the goal.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is not entirely aligned with the ground truth goals because it includes an extra condition about the robot's position that is not mentioned in the ground truths. The similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
