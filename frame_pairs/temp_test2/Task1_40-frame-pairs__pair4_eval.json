The predicted goal states to move the robot to B1 and pick up B1, but it does not specify where to move B1 after picking it up.\n\nThe predicted goal is incomplete because it does not mention the final location where B1 should be placed. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal would not necessarily achieve the real goal, as the final destination of B1 is a significant part of the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
