The robot is supposed to move block B1 into SA1 and then move away from SA1, possibly to a specific location (halfway back towards the left edge of the screen).\n\nThe predicted goal simply states to move the robot to the left of SA1. This goal does not mention block B1 or any interaction with it. Therefore, the predicted goal does not contain enough information to achieve the true goal, which involves manipulating block B1.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect, as following the predicted goal would not lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals. The agent would fail to achieve the real goal because it does not involve moving block B1 into SA1.",
