The predicted goal states \"Move B4 to SA1,\" which aligns with the outcome described in all the ground truth goals. The predicted goal does not mention the color or shape of B4, nor does it specify the color of SA1, but since all ground truths agree on the action of moving B4 to SA1 and there is no conflicting information about the identity of B4 or SA1, the predicted goal is assumed to refer to the same block and area.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals. The agent following the predicted goal would succeed in achieving the real goal. The similarity level is (2) Correct.",
