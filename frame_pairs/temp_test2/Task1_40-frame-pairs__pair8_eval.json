The predicted goal also states that B1 should be moved to the top left of the arena. There are no significant differences in the outcome described by the predicted goal and the ground truth goals. The predicted goal tells the agent enough information to achieve the true goal, which is to move B1 to the top left corner.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
