The predicted goal also instructs to move B1 to the top left of the arena. There are no significant differences in the outcome described by the predicted goal and the ground truth goals. The predicted goal does not specify the color or shape of B1, but since all ground truth descriptions refer to the same block B1, this omission does not lead to a different outcome.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
