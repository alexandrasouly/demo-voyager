However, the ground truth goals also mention actions involving block B3, which are not included in the predicted goal. Specifically, the ground truth goals describe moving B3 downwards or to the bottom of the environment, which is a distinct action from what is described for B2.\n\nSince the predicted goal omits the action related to B3, an agent following the predicted goal would not perform any action on B3 and therefore would not achieve the full real goal as described in the ground truths.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
