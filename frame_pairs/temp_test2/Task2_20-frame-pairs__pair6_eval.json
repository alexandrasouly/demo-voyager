The predicted goal states \"Place B3 in SA1,\" which aligns with the outcome described in all the ground truth goals. The predicted goal does not specify the color of B3 or SA1, but since all ground truth goals refer to the same block and special area, the predicted goal is assumed to be referring to the same entities.\n\nThe predicted goal is concise and does not include the method of moving (e.g., \"push\" or \"move upwards\") or the starting position of the robot (\"move backwards to the left edge\"), but these details are not necessary for the completion of the goal as long as B3 ends up in SA1.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
