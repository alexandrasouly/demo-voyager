This means that the predicted goal does not include moving blocks B1, B2, B3, and B5, which are part of the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals. The predicted goal only accounts for one block, whereas the ground truth requires all five blocks to be moved to SA1.",
