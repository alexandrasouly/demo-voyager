The predicted goal simply states to \"Pick up B4,\" which does not necessarily imply moving it towards any specific location or against the boundary of SA1.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is not providing enough information to achieve the true goal as described in the ground truths. The agent might pick up B4 but without the instruction to move it towards the green circle or SA1, it would not complete the task as described in the ground truths.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
