The predicted goal simply states \"Pick up B1.\"\n\nThe predicted goal matches the initial action described in the ground truth goals, which is to pick up block B1. However, it does not specify what to do with the block after picking it up, such as moving to the bottom, spinning around, or facing upwards.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is incomplete compared to the ground truth goals. It only covers the first part of the action sequence (picking up the block) but does not provide information on the subsequent actions that are required to achieve the true goal.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect, because an agent that only tries to achieve the predicted goal (picking up B1) will fail in achieving the real goal, which involves additional steps after picking up the block.",
