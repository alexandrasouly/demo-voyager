The predicted goal instructs to move to the top of the arena while holding block B1, but it does not specify the exact location within the top area (top left corner).\n\nHowever, since the predicted goal does not contradict the ground truth goals and includes the essential elements of moving block B1 towards the top of the arena, it is reasonable to infer that the predicted goal could lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals if the agent interprets \"the top of the arena\" as the \"top left corner.\"\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal, as the predicted goal is likely to lead to the same outcome, despite the slight difference in phrasing.",
