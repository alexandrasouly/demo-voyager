The predicted goal states to \"Move B1 into SA1,\" which aligns with the outcome described in all the ground truth goals. The predicted goal does not specify the color or shape of B1 or the color of SA1, but since all ground truth goals refer to a blue circle/block and a special area (which we can infer is also blue based on one of the ground truth descriptions), the predicted goal is still correct as it leads to the same outcome without contradicting any specific details provided in the ground truths.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
