They describe the action in slightly different ways, but the outcome is the same: B5 ends up in SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal states simply, \"Move B5 to SA1.\" This goal aligns with the outcome described in all the ground truth goals. It does not specify the color of B5 or SA1, but since there is no indication that there are multiple blocks or special areas with the same label but different colors, this omission does not change the outcome.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals. The agent following the predicted goal would succeed in achieving the real goal. The similarity level is (2) Correct.",
