The predicted goal states to \"Gather all blocks into SA2.\"\n\nThis predicted goal aligns with the part of the ground truth that requires pushing all blocks into SA2. However, it does not address the requirement of placing blocks B1 and B2 into SA3. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal would succeed in achieving the part of the real goal that involves SA2 but would fail to achieve the real goal involving SA3.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect, as the predicted goal would lead to a different outcome than one of the required outcomes described in the ground truth goals.",
