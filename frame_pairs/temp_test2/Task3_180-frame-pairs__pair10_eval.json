However, three of the ground truth goals specify moving blocks B1 and B2 into SA2, while one of them incorrectly states to push all blocks into SA3. This is likely a mistake since it contradicts the other three ground truths.\n\nThe predicted goal states to \"Move B1 and B2 to SA2,\" which aligns with the majority of the ground truth goals that specify moving blocks B1 and B2 into SA2. Therefore, the predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the majority of the ground truth goals. The slight differences in phrasing (e.g., \"Move\" vs. \"Place\" or \"Push\") do not affect the meaning of the goal.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
