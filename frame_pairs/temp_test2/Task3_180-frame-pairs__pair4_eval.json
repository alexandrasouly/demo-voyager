    "cot": "The ground truth goals all involve moving blocks B1 and B2 into a specific area labeled SA2. The predicted goal also specifies moving blocks B1 and B2 into SA2. Despite slight variations in wording, the outcome described by the predicted goal matches the outcome described by the ground truth goals. However, one of the ground truth goals includes an additional action of reversing back to SA3 after pushing the blocks into SA2, which is not mentioned in the predicted goal.\n\nSince the predicted goal does not include the action of reversing back to SA3, it is not entirely clear if this action is essential to the true goal or not. If the reversal to SA3 is a necessary part of the true goal, then the predicted goal would be incorrect as it would not lead to the same outcome. If the reversal is not necessary, then the predicted goal would be correct.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot determine whether the reversal to SA3 is a required part of the goal or an additional, non-essential action. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(3) Unknown: There is not enough information to determine whether the predicted goal is correct or incorrect without additional context regarding the necessity of reversing back to SA3.",
