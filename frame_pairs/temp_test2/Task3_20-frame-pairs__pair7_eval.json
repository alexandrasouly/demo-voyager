The predicted goal only mentions moving block B1 to the middle of the arena, which does not necessarily align with moving it closer to SA2 or the top-right corner. Since the predicted goal does not address the movement of blocks B2 and B5 at all, nor does it specify moving B1 towards SA2, it is meaningfully different from the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect. An agent following the predicted goal would not achieve the real goal as it would not move all the required blocks to the correct location.",
