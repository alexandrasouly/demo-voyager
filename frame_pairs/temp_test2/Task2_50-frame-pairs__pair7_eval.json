The predicted goal only mentions moving block B4 to SA1 and omits any mention of block B1.\n\nSince the predicted goal does not include moving block B1 to SA1, an agent following the predicted goal would not achieve the real goal as described in the ground truth. The agent would only move block B4 and leave block B1 wherever it was, failing to satisfy the condition of having both B1 and B4 in SA1.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
