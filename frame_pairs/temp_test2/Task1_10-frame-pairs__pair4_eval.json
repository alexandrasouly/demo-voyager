    "cot": "The ground truth goals all describe actions involving moving block B1 in a specific direction or to a specific location. The predicted goal also involves moving with block B1, but it does not specify a direction other than \"upwards.\"\n\nThe ground truth goals specify:\n1. Moving the blue square block B1 upwards.\n2. Moving to the bottom left to pick up block B1 and then presumably moving it from there.\n3. Pulling B1 up in the y-direction, which is upwards, about a third of the arena.\n4. Moving block B1 to the left edge of the arena.\n\nThe predicted goal states:\n- Move upwards with block B1.\n\nThe predicted goal aligns with the first and third ground truth goals, which both involve moving block B1 upwards. It does not contradict the second ground truth goal, as moving to the bottom left and picking up block B1 could be a precursor to moving upwards with it. The fourth ground truth goal involves moving the block to the left edge, which is not necessarily upwards, but the predicted goal does not preclude this action either.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is sufficiently similar to the ground truth goals in that it would lead to the same outcome of moving block B1 upwards, which is a part of what is described in the ground truths. The predicted goal is less specific than the ground truths but does not conflict with them.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
