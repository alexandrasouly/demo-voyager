The predicted goal, however, only mentions adjusting the position of B1 within the central area of the arena. This is a meaningful difference because the central area of the arena is not the same as the top left corner. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal would not achieve the real goal as described in the ground truths.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
