However, none of the ground truth goals mention moving to the center of the arena as the final location for B1. The predicted goal specifies picking up B1, which aligns with the ground truth goals, but it adds a specific location that is not mentioned in any of the ground truth goals: \"move to the center of the arena.\"\n\nSince the predicted goal includes an action that would lead to a different outcome (moving B1 to the center of the arena) than the outcomes described in the ground truth goals (which do not specify where to move B1 after picking it up), the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
