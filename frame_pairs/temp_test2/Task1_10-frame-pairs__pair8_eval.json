    "cot": "The ground truth goals describe a sequence of actions involving a yellow triangle block labeled B1. The agent is to back away from B1, move to the top left to place B1, move backward into the center of the grid leaving B1 where it is, and finally move to the center of the arena.\n\nThe predicted goal instructs the agent to release B1 at the top left.\n\nThe predicted goal aligns with part of the ground truth goals, specifically the action of placing B1 at the top left. However, the predicted goal does not mention backing away from B1, moving backward into the center of the grid, or moving to the center of the arena afterward.\n\nDespite the differences in the sequence of actions, the core outcome of placing B1 at the top left is captured in the predicted goal. Therefore, the predicted goal is correct as it leads to the same key outcome as the ground truth goals, even though it omits some steps that do not alter the final position of B1.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
