The predicted goal, however, refers to picking up a different block, B3, which is not mentioned in any of the ground truth descriptions. Since the predicted goal specifies a different block and does not mention moving it to the blue special area SA1, the outcome of following the predicted goal would be different from the outcome described in the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
