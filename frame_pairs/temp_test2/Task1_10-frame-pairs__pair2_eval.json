    "cot": "The ground truth goals all specify moving a particular block, B1, which is a green triangle, to the top left corner or towards it. The predicted goal mentions moving \"R and B1 upwards towards the top of the arena.\" This predicted goal aligns with the ground truth goals in terms of the direction (upwards/towards the top left) and the block involved (B1). However, it includes \"R,\" which presumably stands for the robot, but this inclusion does not change the outcome of the goal, which is to move B1 towards the top left corner.\n\nThe predicted goal does not specify reaching the corner but moving upwards towards the top of the arena. This could be interpreted as not necessarily reaching the top left corner but moving in that general direction. However, since one of the ground truth goals mentions pushing block B1 \"half way to the top left,\" the predicted goal could still be considered to lead to the same outcome, as it does not contradict the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is (2) Correct, as an agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal, despite the slight differences in phrasing.",
