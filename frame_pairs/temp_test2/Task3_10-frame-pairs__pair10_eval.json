The actions are about orienting the robot and making a gentle contact with the block.\n\nThe predicted goal, however, states that the robot is moving to pick up block B1. This implies an action that goes beyond nudging the block slightly\u2014it suggests that the robot will attempt to lift or carry the block.\n\nGiven this difference in the intended interaction with block B1 (nudging vs. picking up), the predicted goal would lead to a different outcome than the one described in the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
