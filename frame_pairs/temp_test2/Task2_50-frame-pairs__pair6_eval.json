However, the fourth ground truth goal mentions a different block, B2, which does not match the predicted goal.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because it does not account for moving block B2 into SA1, which is part of the ground truth goals.",
