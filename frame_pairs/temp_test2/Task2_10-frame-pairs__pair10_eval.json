They also mention that SA1 is associated with the color green or that B5 should be moved next to the right edge of SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal states to \"Move B5 to SA1,\" which aligns with the ground truth goals' intent of having block B5 and SA1 in proximity. The predicted goal does not specify the color of SA1 or the position of B5 relative to the edges of SA1, but these details do not seem to be critical to the core objective of moving B5 to SA1.\n\nGiven this information, the predicted goal is likely to lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals, which is having B5 in SA1. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
