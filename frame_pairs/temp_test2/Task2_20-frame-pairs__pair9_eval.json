The predicted goal, however, only mentions the robot R moving slightly lower while holding B4, with no mention of SA1 or the final placement of the block.\n\nThe predicted goal does not align with the ground truth goals because it does not specify the end state of block B4 being in SA1. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal would not necessarily achieve the real goal.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
