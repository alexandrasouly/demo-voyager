    "cot": "The ground truth goals all specify that block B3, which is a green square, should be moved to special area SA1. The predicted goal also states to move B3 to SA1, without specifying the color or shape of the block, which is not necessary since the block's label (B3) is unique. However, one of the ground truth goals mentions an additional action of nudging two purple triangles up and to the left, which is not included in the predicted goal. \n\nSince the main objective in all the ground truth descriptions is to move B3 to SA1, and the predicted goal aligns with this objective, the predicted goal is correct. The additional action with the purple triangles does not change the main objective, so it can be considered extra information that does not affect the correctness of the predicted goal in terms of achieving the main objective.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is (2) Correct.",
