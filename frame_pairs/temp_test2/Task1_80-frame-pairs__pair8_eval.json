They describe a sequence of actions that involve moving to the block, picking it up, and placing it in the specified location.\n\nThe predicted goal, on the other hand, simply states \"Move R to B1.\" This goal only describes the action of moving the robot to the block but does not specify what should be done with the block once the robot reaches it. It does not mention moving the block to the top left corner or any other subsequent actions.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is not sufficient to achieve the real goal as described in the ground truth. The agent following the predicted goal would move to block B1 but would not necessarily know to pick it up and place it in the top left corner.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect, as the predicted goal does not contain enough information for the agent to achieve the real goal.",
