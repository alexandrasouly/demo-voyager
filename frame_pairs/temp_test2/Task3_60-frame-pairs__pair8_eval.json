    "cot": "The predicted goal \"Move B2 to SA1\" is essentially the same as the ground truth goals, which all describe the action of moving block B2 to special area SA1. The predicted goal does not specify the shape or color of B2, but since all ground truth descriptions refer to the same block B2 and there is no indication that there are multiple blocks with the same label, it is reasonable to assume that B2 is uniquely identified and its properties are not necessary for the completion of the goal. The additional instruction in one of the ground truths to reverse back towards SA2 after pushing B2 into SA1 does not change the main objective of moving B2 to SA1, which is the core action required.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is (2) Correct.",
