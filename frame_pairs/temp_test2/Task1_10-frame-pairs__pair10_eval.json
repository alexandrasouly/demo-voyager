The predicted goal instructs the robot (R) to move to B1 and interact with it. \"Interact\" is a more general term, but in the context of the environment where the robot is meant to manipulate blocks, it can be reasonably inferred that \"interact\" means to perform an action like picking up or grabbing the block.\n\nSince the predicted goal would lead the agent to move to B1 and perform an action that is consistent with the ground truth goals of grabbing the block, the predicted goal is correct. It tells the agent enough information to achieve the true goal without providing extraneous details.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
