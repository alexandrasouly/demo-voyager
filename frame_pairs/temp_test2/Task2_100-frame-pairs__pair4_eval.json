The predicted goal mentions moving block B4 to a location that is not specified in the ground truth goals (\"middle left of the arena\") and placing B1 and B2 into SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal is partially correct because it includes placing B1 and B2 into SA1, which aligns with the ground truth goals. However, it is incorrect regarding the action to be taken with B4; the ground truth goals specify moving B4 into SA1, not to the \"middle left of the arena.\"\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals regarding the location of B4.",
