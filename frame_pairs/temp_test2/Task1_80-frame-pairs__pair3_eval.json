The predicted goal also describes moving block B1 to the top left of the arena. Despite slight variations in phrasing, such as \"pick up\" and \"place,\" or specifying the block as a \"green square,\" all descriptions are consistent in the outcome they describe: block B1 should end up in the top left corner.\n\nThe predicted goal does not mention the color or shape of the block, but since all ground truth goals refer to the same block B1, the lack of this detail in the predicted goal does not change the outcome. Additionally, the predicted goal does not mention moving back a quarter of the arena size after placing the block, but this action does not affect the final position of block B1, which is the main objective.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals. The agent following the predicted goal would succeed in achieving the real goal.",
