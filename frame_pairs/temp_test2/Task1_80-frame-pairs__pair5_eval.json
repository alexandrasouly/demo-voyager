The predicted goal only mentions picking up block B1, without specifying where to move it afterward.\n\nThe predicted goal is incomplete compared to the ground truth goals. An agent following the predicted goal would only pick up block B1 but would not have information on where to place it. Therefore, the predicted goal is not sufficient for the agent to achieve the real goal.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
