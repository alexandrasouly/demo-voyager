They all specify that the block should be grabbed or picked up, although one of them also includes an additional action of making an eighth turn to the left after grabbing the block.\n\nThe predicted goal simply states \"Pick up B1.\" This matches the core action described in all the ground truth goals, which is to pick up block B1. The predicted goal does not mention the additional action of turning, but since all ground truth descriptions agree on the necessity of picking up B1, and the turning does not seem to be a part of the actual goal but rather a specific action that might be part of a sequence to achieve the goal, the predicted goal is likely to lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is (2) Correct.",
