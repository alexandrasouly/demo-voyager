The predicted goal instructs to move the robot to B1 and pick it up, but it does not specify where to place B1 after picking it up.\n\nThe predicted goal is incomplete because it lacks the final destination for B1, which is a crucial part of the ground truth goals. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal would not necessarily succeed in achieving the real goal, as it would not know to place B1 in the top left corner.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
