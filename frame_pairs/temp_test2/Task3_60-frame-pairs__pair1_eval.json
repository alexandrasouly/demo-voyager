The predicted goal, however, only mentions moving B4 and placing it on top of B2 within SA3, without any mention of B1. This difference in the predicted goal suggests a specific arrangement of blocks (B4 on top of B2) that is not mentioned in the ground truth goals. Additionally, the omission of B1 means that following the predicted goal would not result in B1 being moved to SA3, which is required by the ground truth.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is incorrect because an agent following it would not achieve the real goal as described in the ground truth. The agent would fail to move B1 and would also introduce an additional requirement of stacking B4 on B2, which is not part of the ground truth. The similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
