The predicted goal also instructs to move B1 to the top left of the arena. There is no mention of the color or shape of B1 in the predicted goal, but since B1 is a unique identifier for the block, this information is implicit. The predicted goal is aligned with the outcome described in the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
