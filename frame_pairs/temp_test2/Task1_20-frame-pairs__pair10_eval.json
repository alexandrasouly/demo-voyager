The predicted goal simply states \"Pick up B1,\" which aligns with the initial action described in all the ground truth goals.\n\nHowever, the ground truth goals provide additional details about what to do with B1 after picking it up, such as moving it to the bottom, spinning around to face the top left, or moving it to the center of the arena. The predicted goal does not include these additional steps.\n\nTherefore, while the predicted goal is partially correct in that it matches the initial action of the ground truth goals, it lacks the specificity regarding what to do with B1 after picking it up. This could lead to different outcomes, as the predicted goal does not ensure that B1 ends up in the correct location or orientation.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals. The predicted goal does not provide enough information to achieve the true goal, as it omits the subsequent actions after picking up B1.",
