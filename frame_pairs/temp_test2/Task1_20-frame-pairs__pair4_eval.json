The predicted goal states to move B1 to the top of the arena, which is not as specific about the horizontal position (left or right) within the top area of the arena.\n\nThe predicted goal could be interpreted as moving B1 anywhere along the top edge of the arena, which includes but is not specific to the top left corner. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal might move B1 to the top center or top right instead of the top left corner, failing to achieve the real goal as described in the ground truths.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
