The predicted goal does not specify the color of the block or the manner in which it should be moved (e.g., spinning around 180 to the right), but these details are not necessary for the completion of the goal as long as B4 ends up in SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal tells the agent enough information to achieve the true goal, which is to move block B4 into special area SA1, without any extraneous details. Therefore, the predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the set of ground truths.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
