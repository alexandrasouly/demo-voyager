The predicted goal simply states \"Move R to B1,\" which lacks the specificity of the actions described in the ground truth goals.\n\nHowever, the predicted goal could be interpreted as encompassing the actions described in the ground truth goals since moving to B1 could involve turning towards it, moving to the bottom of it, and potentially nudging it if that's part of the movement process.\n\nGiven that the predicted goal is less specific but not necessarily contradictory to the ground truth goals, the predicted goal could lead to the same outcome, albeit with less detail on how to achieve it.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is (2) Correct, as the agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will likely succeed in achieving the real goal, despite the differences in phrasing.",
