    "cot": "The ground truth goals all describe a two-step process: first, moving block B2 (a blue circle) to a special area labeled SA1, and second, interacting with block B1 (also a blue circle). The interactions with B1 vary slightly in description, with phrases like \"grab,\" \"pick up,\" and \"go back and grab\" being used.\n\nThe predicted goal states to \"Move B2 to SA1 and pick up B1.\" This predicted goal aligns with the two-step process described in the ground truths: moving B2 to SA1 is clearly mentioned in all ground truths, and picking up B1 is a reasonable interpretation of the various ways the ground truths describe interacting with B1.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals. The agent would first move B2 to SA1 and then interact with B1, which is consistent with the ground truths. The slight differences in phrasing do not affect the meaning of the goal or the outcome.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
