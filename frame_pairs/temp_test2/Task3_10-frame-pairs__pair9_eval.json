The predicted goal, however, only mentions \"Move towards B3,\" which does not specify what should be done with the block once the robot has moved towards it. The predicted goal does not ensure that B3 will end up in SA1, which is the specific outcome described in the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
