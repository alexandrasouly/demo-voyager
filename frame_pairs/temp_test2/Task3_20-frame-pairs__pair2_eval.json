The predicted goal conveys the essential information needed for an agent to achieve the true goal: the specific block (B2) and the target location (SA3). The differences in phrasing, such as specifying the color or shape of the block, or the action of grasping, do not affect the outcome of the goal.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
