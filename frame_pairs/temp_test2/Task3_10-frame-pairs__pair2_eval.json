The predicted goal, on the other hand, simply states to move the robot (R) with B2 to the left.\n\nThe predicted goal does not align with any of the actions described in the ground truth goals. Moving to the left is not the same as moving upwards, rotating towards a specific goal region, or moving to the center of the arena. Therefore, the predicted goal would not lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect. An agent following the predicted goal would fail to achieve the real goal as described in the ground truth.",
