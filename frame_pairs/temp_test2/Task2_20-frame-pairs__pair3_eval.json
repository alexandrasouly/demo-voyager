The predicted goal states to \"Move B3 to SA1,\" which aligns with the outcome described in the ground truth goals. The predicted goal does not specify the color of B3 or SA1, but since all ground truth descriptions agree on these details, we can infer that the predicted goal refers to the same block and location.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is (2) Correct, as an agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal described by the ground truth goals.",
