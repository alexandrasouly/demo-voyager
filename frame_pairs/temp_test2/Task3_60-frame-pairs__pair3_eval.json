The predicted goal, however, states to move B4 to the bottom right area, which does not necessarily correspond to SA1's location based on the given information.\n\nThe predicted goal is incorrect because it specifies a different location (\"the bottom right area\") than the special area SA1 mentioned in all the ground truth descriptions.
