The predicted goal states to move B1 to the top of the arena, which is less specific about the exact location within the top area (it does not specify \"left corner\").\n\nHowever, since the predicted goal does not contradict the ground truth goals and moving B1 to the top of the arena could include the top left corner, the predicted goal could lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals. Therefore, the predicted goal is correct but less specific. \n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
