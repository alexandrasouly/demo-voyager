The predicted goal instructs the robot (R) to move to B1 and interact with it. \n\nInteracting with a block could mean a variety of actions, but given the context of the ground truth goals, which all involve picking up the block, it's reasonable to infer that \"interact with it\" in the predicted goal refers to picking up the block as well. \n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is likely instructing the same outcome as the ground truth goals, which is to move to block B1 and pick it up. \n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
