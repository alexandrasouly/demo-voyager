    "cot": "Let's compare the predicted goal to each ground truth goal:\n\n1. \"Grab the blue square block B1.\" - The predicted goal \"Pick up B1.\" is equivalent to grabbing B1, so this matches in terms of the action and the block involved.\n\n2. \"Move to bottom and pick up block B1\" - The predicted goal does not specify moving to the bottom, but it does involve picking up B1. Since the location is not specified in the predicted goal, it's not clear if the outcome would be the same.\n\n3. \"Grab B1 then spin around to face towards the top left\" - The predicted goal includes picking up B1 but does not mention spinning around to face the top left. The final orientation of the robot is not achieved in the predicted goal.\n\n4. \"Move block B1 to the center of the arena.\" - The predicted goal does not specify moving B1 to the center of the arena, only picking it up.\n\nThe predicted goal is correct in terms of picking up B1, which is a common action in all ground truth goals. However, it lacks the specificity of location and orientation mentioned in the ground truths. Since the predicted goal does not contradict the ground truths but is less specific, it could lead to the same initial action (picking up B1) but not necessarily to the complete outcome described in the ground truths.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal, as the initial action of picking up B1 is common to all ground truth goals, even though the predicted goal lacks specificity about the subsequent actions or final position.",
