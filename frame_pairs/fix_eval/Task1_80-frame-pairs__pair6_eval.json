They also imply that the robot will be the one moving the block, either by directly stating the robot's movement or by the nature of the task.\n\nThe predicted goal simply states \"Move R to B1,\" which implies that the robot should approach block B1. However, it does not specify what should be done with the block once the robot reaches it, nor does it mention the top left corner as the destination for the block.\n\nGiven this information, the predicted goal is incomplete when compared to the ground truth goals. It matches the initial action of approaching block B1 but does not include the crucial step of moving the block to the top left corner. Therefore, an agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will not succeed in achieving the real goal as it stands.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
