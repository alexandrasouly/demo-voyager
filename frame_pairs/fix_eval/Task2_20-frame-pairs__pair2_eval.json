The predicted goal simply states \"Pick up B1.\" without specifying what should be done with B1 after picking it up.\n\nLet's compare the predicted goal to each ground truth goal:\n\n1. \"Move green circle B1 to green special area SA1\" - The predicted goal does not mention moving B1 to SA1.\n2. \"Move left and pick up block B1 and move to special area SA1 with block B1 and place it in the special area\" - The predicted goal does not mention moving to SA1 or placing B1 in the special area.\n3. \"Grasp B1 then turn around and push it into SA1\" - The predicted goal does not mention turning around or pushing B1 into SA1.\n4. \"Move ball B1 to special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal does not mention moving B1 to SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal only includes the action of picking up B1, but does not include the subsequent action of moving it to SA1, which is a key part of the ground truth goals. Therefore, the predicted goal is incomplete and would not lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
