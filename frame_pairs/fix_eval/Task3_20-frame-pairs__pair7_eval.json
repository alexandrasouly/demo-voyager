The predicted goal only mentions moving B1 to the middle of the arena, which does not necessarily align with moving it closer to SA2 or to the top-right corner of the arena. Since the predicted goal does not address the movement of B2 and B5 at all and specifies a different location for B1, it would lead to a different outcome than the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
