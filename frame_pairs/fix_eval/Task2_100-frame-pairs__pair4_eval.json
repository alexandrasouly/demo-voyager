    "cot": "Let's compare the predicted goal with each ground truth goal:\n\n1. \"Move blue circle B1 and B2 inside special area SA1 and grab blue circle B4.\"\n   - The predicted goal mentions moving B1 and B2 into SA1, which matches this part of the ground truth. However, it says to move B4 to the middle left of the arena, which does not match the action of grabbing B4 as stated in the ground truth.\n\n2. \"Pick up blocks B1 and B2, and put them into special area SA1.\"\n   - The predicted goal matches this ground truth as it involves placing B1 and B2 into SA1. However, there is no mention of B4 in this ground truth, so the action with B4 in the predicted goal is not addressed here.\n\n3. \"Push B1 and B2 into SA1, then grab B4 and push it down half way to SA1.\"\n   - The predicted goal's action of placing B1 and B2 into SA1 aligns with this ground truth. However, the action with B4 differs; the ground truth specifies grabbing B4 and pushing it halfway to SA1, while the predicted goal specifies moving B4 to the middle left of the arena.\n\n4. \"Move balls B1 and B2 to special area SA1, and pick up ball B4.\"\n   - The predicted goal aligns with moving B1 and B2 to SA1 but diverges in the action with B4, similar to the first ground truth.\n\nThe predicted goal is partially correct in that it matches the action of moving B1 and B2 to SA1. However, it is incorrect regarding the action to be taken with B4. The ground truths all involve grabbing or picking up B4, while the predicted goal involves moving B4 to a different location (middle left of the arena). This difference in action with B4 would lead to a different outcome, making the predicted goal incorrect in terms of fully achieving the real goal.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
