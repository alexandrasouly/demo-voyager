The predicted goal, however, states that B4 should be moved to the \"bottom right area,\" which does not match the location specified in the ground truth goals (SA1). Additionally, the ground truth goals mention SA1 as being pink and red, which is a discrepancy, but since all ground truths refer to SA1, the color mentioned may not be significant for matching the prediction. However, the predicted goal's direction is explicitly different (\"bottom right area\" vs. SA1's location).\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is incorrect because it specifies a different location than the one mentioned in all the ground truth goals. The agent following the predicted goal would not achieve the real goal as it would move B4 to a different location than SA1. \n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
