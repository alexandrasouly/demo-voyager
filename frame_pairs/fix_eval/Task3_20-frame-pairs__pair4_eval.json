Assuming it's a typo, the predicted goal matches the intended outcome. If \"A2\" is not a typo, then this ground truth would not match the predicted goal.\n4. \"Place block B1 in special area SA2.\" - The predicted goal is equivalent to this description, as both indicate that B1 should end up in SA2.\n\nThe predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals, which is having B1 in SA2. The slight differences in phrasing do not affect the meaning of the goal. Therefore, the similarity level is (2) Correct.",
