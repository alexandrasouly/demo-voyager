However, since the predicted goal does not contradict the action with B4, it is still correct regarding that part of the goal.\n4. \"Move block B4 into special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal is essentially the same as this ground truth goal.\n\nThe predicted goal is correct because it matches the outcome of moving B4 to SA1 as described in all the ground truth goals. The additional details in the ground truths do not affect the outcome related to B4 and SA1. Therefore, the similarity level is (2) Correct.",
