The predicted goal states that the robot (R) should move to B1 and pick it up, but it does not specify where the block should be moved to after it is picked up.\n\nSince the predicted goal lacks the information about the final location of block B1, it is not clear whether the robot would achieve the real goal of placing B1 in the top left corner. Therefore, the predicted goal is incomplete when compared to the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals. The difference here is the lack of a specified final location for block B1 in the predicted goal.",
