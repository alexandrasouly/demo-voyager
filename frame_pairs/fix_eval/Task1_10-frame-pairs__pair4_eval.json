The outcome is not clearly the same, as the starting position is not mentioned in the prediction.\n\n3. \"Pull B1 up in the y-direction, about a third of the arena\" - The predicted goal aligns with this action as moving upwards with block B1 would involve pulling it in the y-direction.\n\n4. \"Move block B1 to the left edge of the arena.\" - The predicted goal does not specify moving to the left edge, only moving upwards.\n\nThe predicted goal is similar to the first and third ground truth goals as they both involve moving block B1 upwards. The second and fourth ground truth goals involve additional specific actions or locations that are not mentioned in the predicted goal. However, since the predicted goal matches at least one of the ground truth goals, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal, as it matches at least one of the ground truth descriptions.",
