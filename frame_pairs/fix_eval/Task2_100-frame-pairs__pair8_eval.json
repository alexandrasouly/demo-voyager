However, since B2's movement does not affect the outcome for B4, the predicted goal is still correct.\n4. \"Move block B4 inside special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal is a direct match for this description.\n\nThe predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as described in all the ground truth goals. The slight differences in phrasing do not affect the meaning of the goal. Therefore, the similarity level is (2) Correct.",
