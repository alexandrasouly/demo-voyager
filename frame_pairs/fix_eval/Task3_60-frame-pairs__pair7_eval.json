The predicted goal only mentions moving B2 and does not specify moving it to SA2, but rather to the center of the arena. This is a meaningful difference because the predicted goal does not lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals. The blocks are not being moved to the same location, and not all the specified blocks are being moved.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
