    "cot": "Let's compare the predicted goal with each ground truth statement:\n\n1. \"Move blue circle B2 to blue special area SA1\" - The predicted goal \"Place B2 inside SA1\" matches this statement as it describes the same action and outcome, despite not mentioning the color or shape of B2 or SA1.\n\n2. \"Move to special area SA1 with block B2 and place it in the special area SA1\" - The predicted goal is again consistent with this statement, as it involves placing B2 in SA1.\n\n3. \"Grab B2 and leave it in SA1, displacing B3 downwards slightly (but both are in SA1 at the end), then move to the top left of SA1\" - The predicted goal matches the first part of this statement, which is to place B2 in SA1. The displacement of B3 and the subsequent movement of the robot are additional actions that do not affect the outcome related to B2 and SA1.\n\n4. \"Move balls B2 into special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal aligns with this statement as well, as it involves moving B2 into SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal \"Place B2 inside SA1\" is consistent with all the ground truth statements in terms of the final outcome of B2 being in SA1. The differences in phrasing and additional details do not change the outcome that B2 ends up in SA1.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
