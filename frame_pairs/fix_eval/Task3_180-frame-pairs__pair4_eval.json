However, since the outcome of moving B1 and B2 into SA2 is achieved, the difference in the second part of the instruction does not affect the similarity in terms of the outcome for B1 and B2.\n4. \"Move all the blocks to special area SA2.\" - The predicted goal matches this ground truth goal as well, assuming that \"all the blocks\" refers to B1 and B2.\n\nThe predicted goal matches the outcome of the ground truth goals, which is to have B1 and B2 in SA2.
