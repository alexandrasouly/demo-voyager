The second part about moving the robot back is not mentioned, but it does not affect the outcome regarding the position of B1.\n4. \"Place block B1 in special area SA3.\" - The predicted goal is in agreement with this statement as well.\n\nThe predicted goal is correct because it would lead to the same outcome as the set of ground truths. The slight differences in phrasing do not affect the meaning of the goal. The similarity level is (2) Correct.",
