The predicted goal, however, states a subgoal of maintaining the current position and holding B1, which implies not moving from the current location but simply holding the block.\n\nSince the ground truth goals require movement of B1 to a specific location (top left corner) and the predicted goal requires staying in place while holding B1, the outcomes are different. The agent following the predicted goal would not achieve the real goal as described in the ground truths.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
