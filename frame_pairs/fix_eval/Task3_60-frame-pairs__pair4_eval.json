The reversing part is not mentioned, but it does not affect the outcome regarding the location of B2.\n4. \"Move block B2 into special area SA2.\" - The predicted goal is directly aligned with this statement.\n\nThe predicted goal is consistent with all the ground truth goals in terms of the final outcome, which is having B2 in SA2. The slight differences in phrasing do not change the meaning of the goal.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
