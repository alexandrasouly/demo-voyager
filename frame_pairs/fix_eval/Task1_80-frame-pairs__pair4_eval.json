However, the predicted goal also includes moving R to the top center, which is not mentioned in the ground truth. This additional action does not affect the outcome of B1's location.\n\n2. \"Move to bottom and pick up block B1 and move to top left with block B1 and place block B1 on top left\" - The predicted goal achieves the same outcome of placing B1 on the top left, despite not mentioning the initial position of the robot or the action of picking up the block. The action of moving R to the top center is not contradictory to the ground truth.\n\n3. \"Move B1 to the top left corner then move back a bit\" - The predicted goal aligns with moving B1 to the top left corner. The action of moving R to the top center does not conflict with moving back a bit, as these could be separate actions.\n\n4. \"Place block B1 in the top-left corner of the arena.\" - The predicted goal matches this ground truth goal in terms of the final location of B1.\n\nThe predicted goal is consistent with the outcome of all ground truth goals, which is to have B1 in the top left corner. The additional action of moving R to the top center does not change the outcome for B1. Therefore, the predicted goal is (2) Correct.",
