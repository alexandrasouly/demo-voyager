    "cot": "Let's compare the predicted goal with each ground truth goal:\n\n1. \"Move blue triangle B2 and pink triangle B1 inside pink special area SA3.\" - The predicted goal specifies moving B2 to SA3 and placing it on top of B1, which implies that B1 is already in SA3 or will be moved there as well. This matches the ground truth in terms of the final location of the blocks but adds the specific arrangement of B2 on top of B1.\n\n2. \"Place the blocks B2 and B1 into special area SA3\" - The predicted goal is consistent with this ground truth in terms of the final location of the blocks, but again specifies the arrangement of B2 on top of B1.\n\n3. \"Move B1 and B2 into SA3 then reverse back out of SA3\" - The predicted goal does not mention reversing out of SA3, so it does not match this ground truth.\n\n4. \"Push all the blocks inside special area SA3.\" - The predicted goal specifies only B2 and its placement on top of B1, not all blocks. If there are more blocks than B1 and B2, the predicted goal would not achieve the ground truth goal.\n\nThe predicted goal is consistent with the first two ground truths in terms of the final location of B1 and B2, but it adds a specific arrangement that is not mentioned in the ground truths. However, since the predicted goal does not contradict the final outcome of having B1 and B2 in SA3, and does not specify actions that would prevent the ground truth goals from being achieved, the predicted goal is considered correct. The additional detail of placing B2 on top of B1 does not change the outcome of the blocks being in SA3.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
