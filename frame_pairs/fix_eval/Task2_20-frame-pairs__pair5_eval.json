The predicted goal, however, refers to block B3, which is not mentioned in any of the ground truth statements. Since the predicted goal involves a different block entirely, the outcome of following the predicted goal would not match the outcome described in the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
