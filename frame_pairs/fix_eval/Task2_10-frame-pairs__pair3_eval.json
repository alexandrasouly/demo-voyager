It is assumed that moving B3 to SA1 would result in B3 being in SA1, regardless of the specific location within the area.\n4. \"Move block B3 into special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal is a less detailed version of this statement but still matches the intended outcome.\n\nThe predicted goal is consistent with all the ground truth goals in terms of the outcome, which is moving block B3 to special area SA1. The lack of specificity about the exact location within SA1 in the predicted goal does not change the outcome of B3 being in SA1.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
