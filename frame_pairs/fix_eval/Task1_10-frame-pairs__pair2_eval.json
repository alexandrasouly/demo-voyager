The direction \"upwards\" is more general and could lead to a different outcome than the specific \"top left corner\" mentioned in the ground truths.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
