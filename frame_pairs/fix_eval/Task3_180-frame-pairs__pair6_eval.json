The predicted goal matches this ground truth exactly in terms of the blocks being moved and the target location.\n\n2. Ground Truth: Place the blocks B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 into special area SA2.\n   Predicted: Move B1 and B2 to SA3.\n   Similarity: Incorrect. The predicted goal only mentions moving B1 and B2 to SA3, while this ground truth involves moving five blocks to a different special area, SA2.\n\n3. Ground Truth: Push both blocks into SA3 then return robot to original position.\n   Predicted: Move B1 and B2 to SA3.\n   Similarity: Correct. The predicted goal matches the first part of this ground truth. The returning of the robot to its original position is not mentioned in the predicted goal, but it does not change the outcome related to the position of the blocks.\n\n4. Ground Truth: Put both triangles inside special area SA3.\n   Predicted: Move B1 and B2 to SA3.\n   Similarity: Unknown. Without knowing whether B1 and B2 are the triangles mentioned in the ground truth, we cannot determine if the predicted goal is correct.\n\nSince the predicted goal matches the first and third ground truths, we can conclude that the predicted goal is Correct.",
