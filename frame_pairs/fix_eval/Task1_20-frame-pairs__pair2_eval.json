The predicted goal also states that B1 should be moved to the top left of the arena, with the addition of moving R, the robot, to the same location. Since moving the robot along with the block does not change the outcome of the block's final position, the predicted goal matches the outcome described in the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
