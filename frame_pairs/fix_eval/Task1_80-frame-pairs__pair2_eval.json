The predicted goal only mentions picking up B1, without specifying where to move it afterward.\n\nSince the predicted goal does not include the final location for B1, it is incomplete compared to the ground truth goals. An agent following the predicted goal would pick up B1 but would not know to move it to the top left corner as required by the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals. The predicted goal omits the crucial step of placing B1 in the top left corner.",
