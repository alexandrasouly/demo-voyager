The second part of the instruction does not affect the final position of B1 and B2, which is the main goal.\n4. \"Move all the blocks into special area SA3.\" - Assuming B1 and B2 are the only blocks, the predicted goal matches this one as well.\n\nThe predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the set of ground truths.
