They also imply that the robot will be the one moving B1, even if the robot is not explicitly mentioned in every statement.\n\nThe predicted goal simply states \"Move R to B1,\" which suggests that the robot should move towards block B1. However, it does not specify what should be done with B1 once the robot reaches it. There is no mention of moving B1 to the top left corner, which is the critical part of the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is not specific enough to ensure that the robot will achieve the real goal of moving B1 to the top left corner. The predicted goal is too vague and only covers a subset of the actions required by the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect, as the agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because it does not include the necessary action of moving B1 to the top left corner.",
