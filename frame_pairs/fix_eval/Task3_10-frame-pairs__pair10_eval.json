They all involve turning or rotating towards B1, but none of them explicitly mention picking up the block.\n\nThe predicted goal states that the robot is moving to pick up block B1. This implies an intention to perform an action with block B1, which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth goals. The ground truth goals focus on the orientation and slight movement towards the block, not the action of picking it up.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal does not match the ground truth goals because it suggests an additional action (picking up the block) that is not described in the ground truths. The outcome of the predicted goal would be different from the outcome of the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
