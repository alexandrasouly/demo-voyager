The predicted goal, however, states to \"Maintain current position with B1,\" which implies that block B1 should not be moved from its current location.\n\nSince the predicted goal is directing the opposite action of what the ground truth goals are stating (keeping B1 stationary versus moving it to a specific location), the predicted goal would lead to a different outcome than the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
