The predicted goal only states \"Pick up B3,\" without mentioning the final destination of the block.\n\nSince the predicted goal does not specify what to do with B3 after picking it up, it is incomplete when compared to the ground truth goals. The agent might pick up B3 but without the instruction to move it to SA1, the agent will not achieve the real goal.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
