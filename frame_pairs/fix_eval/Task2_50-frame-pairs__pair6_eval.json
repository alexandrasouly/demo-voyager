However, the main objective of placing B3 in SA1 is met.\n4. \"Move block B3 inside special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal is essentially the same as this ground truth goal.\n\nThe predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals. The slight differences in phrasing do not affect the meaning of the goal. The similarity level is (2) Correct.",
