The predicted goal, however, describes a subgoal where the robot R is to move slightly lower while still holding B4. There is no mention of placing B4 into SA1, which is the ultimate goal in all the ground truth descriptions.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is not describing the same outcome as the ground truth goals. The agent following the predicted goal would not achieve the real goal of placing B4 into SA1, as it only mentions moving the robot while holding the block, not the final placement of the block.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
