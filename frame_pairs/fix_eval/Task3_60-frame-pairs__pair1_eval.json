There is no mention of B1 in the predicted goal.\n\nSince the predicted goal does not account for the movement of B1, it would lead to a different outcome than the one described in the ground truth goals. The agent would succeed in stacking B4 on B2 inside SA3 but would fail to move B1 as required by the ground truth.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
