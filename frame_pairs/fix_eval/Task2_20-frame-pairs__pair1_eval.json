The second part of the instruction is about the robot's movement after placing the block, which does not affect the outcome related to the block's position.\n\n4. \"Move block B4 to special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal is exactly the same as this ground truth goal.\n\nSince the predicted goal would lead to the same outcome as described in all the ground truth goals, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
