Ground Truth: Move green square B5 inside special area SA1.\n   Predicted: Place B5 in SA2.\n   - The predicted goal specifies SA2 instead of SA1, which is a different location. This would lead to a different outcome.\n\n2. Ground Truth: Move to special area SA1 with block B5 and place it into special area and move to top left to pick up block B4.\n   Predicted: Place B5 in SA2 and move R and B4 to the center left.\n   - Again, the predicted goal specifies SA2 instead of SA1, and it also mentions moving B4 to the center left, which is not mentioned in the ground truth.\n\n3. Ground Truth: Push B4 into SA1 then move back to almost grasp B4.\n   Predicted: Place B5 in SA2 and move R and B4 to the center left.\n   - The predicted goal does not match this ground truth because it involves placing B5 in SA2, not pushing B4 into SA1.\n\n4. Ground Truth: Move block B5 into the green special area.\n   Predicted: Place B5 in SA2.\n   - The predicted goal does not specify the color of SA2, but since it is a different label from the ground truth, which specifies a green special area (implied to be SA1), the outcome is different.\n\nThe predicted goal does not match any of the ground truth goals because it specifies a different special area (SA2 instead of SA1) and includes actions with B4 that are not consistent with the ground truth descriptions. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect.",
