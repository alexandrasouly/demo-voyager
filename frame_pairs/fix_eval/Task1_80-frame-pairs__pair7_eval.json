    "cot": "The ground truth goals all specify that block B1, which is a pink triangle, should be moved to the top left corner of the arena. They describe the same outcome with slight variations in phrasing, such as moving directly, picking up and then moving, or moving and then returning to the center.\n\nThe predicted goal, however, specifies moving block B1 to the top center of the arena, not the top left corner. This is a different location and would result in a different outcome.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because the predicted goal specifies a different location (top center) than the ground truth goals (top left corner).",
