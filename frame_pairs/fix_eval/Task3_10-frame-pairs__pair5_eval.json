The predicted goal does not specify the color or shape of B1 or the color of SA3, but since the label B1 is correct and the destination SA3 is correct, the outcome is the same.\n\n2. \"Move to special area SA3 with block B1\" - The predicted goal matches this statement as well, as it involves moving B1 to SA3, which is the same outcome.\n\n3. \"Push B1 into SA3\" - The predicted goal matches this statement. The method of moving (pushing) is not specified in the prediction, but the outcome is the same: B1 ends up in SA3.\n\n4. \"Move block B1 into special area SA3.\" - The predicted goal matches this statement, as it involves moving B1 to SA3.\n\nSince the predicted goal matches all the ground truth goals in terms of the outcome, which is moving B1 to SA3, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
