The additional instruction to \"release and back off a bit\" does not change the outcome of B2 being in SA1.\n4. \"Place block B2 in special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal matches this as it involves moving B2 to SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal is consistent with all the ground truth goals in terms of the outcome, which is having block B2 in special area SA1. The slight differences in phrasing do not affect the meaning of the goal.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
