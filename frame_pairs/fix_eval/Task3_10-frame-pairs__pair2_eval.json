The destination is different.\n\nThe predicted goal does not match any of the ground truth goals as it specifies a different direction and does not include any of the specific actions or destinations mentioned in the ground truths. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
