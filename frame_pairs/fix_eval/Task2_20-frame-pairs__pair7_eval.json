The predicted goal only mentions moving the robot within SA1, without any reference to block B1 or specific actions to be taken with it.\n\nLet's compare the predicted goal to each ground truth goal:\n\n1. \"Release pink square B1 inside the pink special area SA1 and back away\" - The predicted goal does not mention block B1 or the action of releasing it inside SA1, nor does it specify backing away.\n\n2. \"Move to special area SA1 with block B1 and place it into special area and move to bottom right\" - The predicted goal does not mention moving with block B1, placing it into SA1, or moving to the bottom right.\n\n3. \"Release B1 in SA1 then drive half of the way down towards B4\" - The predicted goal does not mention releasing B1 in SA1 or driving towards B4.\n\n4. \"Release block B1 and head toward block B4.\" - The predicted goal does not mention releasing B1 or heading toward B4.\n\nThe predicted goal does not match any of the ground truth goals in terms of the specific actions to be taken with block B1 and subsequent movements of the robot. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
