However, since the predicted goal does not contradict the movement of B3, it is still correct regarding B3's movement.\n4. \"Move block B3 inside special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal is in agreement with this statement.\n\nThe predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals concerning the movement of B3 to SA1. The additional instructions about B5 in one of the ground truths do not affect the correctness of the predicted goal regarding B3. \n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
