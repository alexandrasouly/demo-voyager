    "cot": "Let's compare the predicted goal with each ground truth goal:\n\n1. \"Move green square block B5 inside special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal \"Move B5 to SA1.\" matches this description if B5 is indeed the green square block. The action and the outcome are the same.\n\n2. \"Pick up block B5 and put it into special area SA1\" - The predicted goal is equivalent to this statement as well, as moving B5 to SA1 implies picking it up and placing it there.\n\n3. \"Move B4 into SA1 and push the blocks outside SA1 to the left a bit\" - The predicted goal does not match this statement because it refers to B5, not B4, and does not mention pushing other blocks to the left.\n\n4. \"Move ball B5 into special area SA1.\" - If B5 is a ball, the predicted goal matches this statement as it involves moving B5 to SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal matches the first, second, and potentially the fourth ground truth goals, assuming B5 is the correct block and the shape (square or ball) is not crucial for the outcome. It does not match the third ground truth goal as it involves a different block (B4) and additional actions.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct, as the predicted goal would lead to the same outcome as at least one of the ground truth goals.",
