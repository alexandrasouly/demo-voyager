They mention either moving, pushing, or having the block end up next to a special area, with one specifying it should be next to the right edge. The predicted goal states \"Move B5 to SA1,\" which aligns with the outcome described in all the ground truth goals. The predicted goal does not specify the edge or the color of the special area, but since SA1 is mentioned by label and there is no indication that there are multiple SA1 areas with different colors, the lack of color specification in the prediction does not lead to a different outcome.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is (2) Correct, as an agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal described by the ground truth goals.",
