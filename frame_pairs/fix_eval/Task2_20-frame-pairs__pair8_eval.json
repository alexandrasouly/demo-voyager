    "cot": "Let's compare the predicted goal with each ground truth goal:\n\n1. \"Move green square B4 to green special area SA1\" - The predicted goal \"Move B4 into SA1\" matches this description, as it does not contradict any part of the action described.\n\n2. \"Move to special area SA1 with block B3 and place it into special area\" - The predicted goal does not match this description because it specifies moving block B4, not B3.\n\n3. \"Push B4 into SA1 (on the left edge) and nudge B2 down and to the right a bit\" - The predicted goal matches the first part of this description, which is to move B4 into SA1. The second part of the instruction regarding B2 is not mentioned in the predicted goal, but since the predicted goal does not contradict the outcome of B4 being in SA1, it is still considered correct.\n\n4. \"Toss block B4 into special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal \"Move B4 into SA1\" is similar in outcome to tossing B4 into SA1, as both result in B4 being in SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal is correct because it matches at least one of the ground truth goals and leads to the same outcome. The slight differences in phrasing (e.g., \"move\" vs. \"toss\") do not affect the meaning of the goal, which is to have B4 end up in SA1. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct.",
