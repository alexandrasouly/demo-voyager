The predicted goal, however, states to move B1 to the top of the arena, which lacks the leftward direction component present in all the ground truth descriptions. Moving to the top does not necessarily mean moving to the top left corner; it could also imply moving to the top center or top right.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is not the same as the ground truth goals because it would lead to a different outcome. The agent would not end up in the top left corner but rather somewhere along the top edge of the arena.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
