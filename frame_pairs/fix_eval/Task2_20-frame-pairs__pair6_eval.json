The second part of the instruction, \"then move backwards to the left edge,\" is not mentioned in the predicted goal, but it does not affect the outcome related to the placement of B3 in SA1.\n\n4. \"Move block B3 into special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal is in agreement with this statement as both describe the action of moving B3 into SA1.\n\nThe predicted goal is consistent with the outcome described in all the ground truth goals, which is to have B3 placed in SA1. The slight differences in phrasing do not affect the meaning of the goal.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
