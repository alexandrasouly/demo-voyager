The predicted goal involves picking up B1 and moving to the center of the arena.\n\nThe predicted goal does not match any of the ground truth goals exactly. The ground truth goals do not mention moving to the center of the arena as the final step. The predicted goal's final location (center of the arena) is different from the action of rotating to face SA3 mentioned in one of the ground truth goals. Therefore, the predicted goal would lead to a different outcome than at least one of the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
