The predicted goal states to move B1 to the top of the arena, which is not as specific as the ground truth goals. The top of the arena could mean the entire upper area, not necessarily the top left corner.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal does not match the ground truth goals because it lacks the specificity of the final location (top left corner). The agent might end up placing B1 anywhere at the top of the arena, not specifically in the top left corner as required by the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
