The predicted goal, however, only mentions placing B1 on the left side of the arena, without specifying that it should be in the top left corner.\n\nThis difference is meaningful because the left side of the arena could refer to any position along the left edge, not necessarily the top left corner. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal might place B1 anywhere along the left side and not achieve the real goal of placing it in the top left corner specifically.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
