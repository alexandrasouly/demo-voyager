The predicted goal, however, involves moving a different block, B3, to a different special area, SA3.\n\nSince the predicted goal specifies a different block (B3 instead of B5) and a different special area (SA3 instead of SA1), the outcome of the predicted goal would be different from the outcomes described in all the ground truth goals. Therefore, the predicted goal does not match any of the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
