The predicted goal states simply \"Pick up B1.\" without specifying the color or shape of the block or the initial movement towards the block.\n\nDespite the predicted goal not mentioning the color or shape of B1, it is not necessary because the label B1 is specific enough to identify the block. Additionally, the predicted goal does not mention the initial movement towards the block, but this is implicit in the action of picking up the block.\n\nSince all ground truth descriptions lead to the same outcome, which is the block B1 being picked up, and the predicted goal also leads to this same outcome, the predicted goal is correct. The slight differences in phrasing do not affect the meaning of the goal.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
