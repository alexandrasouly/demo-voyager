The predicted goal states to move to the top of the arena while holding block B1, but it does not specify that the block should be moved to the top left corner, only to the top of the arena.\n\nThis difference in the final location of block B1 (top of the arena vs. top left corner) could lead to different outcomes, as the top of the arena may not necessarily be the same as the top left corner. Therefore, the predicted goal does not match the ground truth goals, as it does not ensure that block B1 ends up in the specified top left corner.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
