This could be a different outcome if the center is not upwards from B1's starting position.\n\n2. \"Move to middle with block B1\" - The predicted goal is essentially the same as this ground truth goal, as \"move to the center\" is synonymous with \"move to middle,\" and both specify doing so with block B1.\n\n3. \"Spin around to the right so that B1 moves up by about a third of the arena\" - This ground truth goal describes a specific action (spinning) and a specific outcome (B1 moving up by a third of the arena). The predicted goal does not mention spinning or the distance B1 should move, only that it should be moved to the center.\n\n4. \"Carry block B1 to the center of the arena.\" - The predicted goal matches this ground truth goal exactly, as both describe carrying B1 to the center of the arena.\n\nSince the predicted goal matches at least one of the ground truth goals (specifically the second and fourth ones), the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
