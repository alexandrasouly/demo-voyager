The predicted goal matches this outcome without specifying the shape or color of the block, which is not necessary since the block is uniquely identified by its label (B4). The action described (to move or put the block into SA1) is consistent across all descriptions.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is correct as it would lead to the same outcome as the set of ground truth goals.
