The predicted goal only mentions picking up block B1, without specifying what should be done with the block after it has been picked up.\n\nSince the predicted goal does not include the final location where block B1 should be placed, it is incomplete when compared to the ground truth goals. The action of picking up block B1 is a part of the ground truth goals, but it is only a subset of the actions required to achieve the full goal.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is incorrect because it does not lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals. The agent would pick up the block but would not know where to place it based on the predicted goal alone.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
