    "cot": "Let's compare the predicted goal with each ground truth statement:\n\n1. \"Move the robot towards the green circle block B4.\" - The predicted goal \"Pick up B4\" implies that the robot will move towards B4 in order to pick it up, which aligns with moving towards the block.\n\n2. \"Move towards block B4 and pick up block B4\" - The predicted goal directly matches this ground truth statement, as it involves picking up B4.\n\n3. \"Push B4 forward a bit, so that it's right up against the boundary of SA1\" - The predicted goal does not specify pushing B4 to a specific location, just picking it up. This could be seen as a partial match, but the final position of B4 is not addressed in the prediction.\n\n4. \"Push block B4 further down.\" - Similar to the previous statement, the predicted goal does not specify pushing B4 in any direction, just picking it up.\n\nThe predicted goal is correct because it matches at least one of the ground truth goals, specifically the second one, which explicitly states to pick up block B4. The other ground truth goals imply movement towards and interaction with B4, which would be necessary to pick it up, even if they include additional actions or specific locations. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
