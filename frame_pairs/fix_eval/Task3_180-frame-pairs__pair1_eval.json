The ground truth goals use different verbs such as \"push\" and \"place,\" but these do not change the outcome, which is to have all the specified blocks in SA3. The predicted goal does not contradict any of the ground truth goals in terms of the blocks to be moved or the destination.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is (2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
