    "cot": "The predicted goal is \"Move B1 to SA3.\"\n\nComparing this to the ground truth goals:\n\n1. \"Move green circle block B1 inside SA3.\" - The predicted goal matches this description, as it specifies moving B1 to SA3 without contradicting any details.\n2. \"Move to the bottom left and pick up B1 and place it into special area SA3\" - The predicted goal is less specific about the starting position and the action of picking up, but the end result is the same: B1 is placed in SA3.\n3. \"Move B1 into SA3 then reverse back to sit near the bottom of the arena\" - The predicted goal matches the first part of this instruction, which is moving B1 into SA3. The reversing action is not mentioned, but it does not affect the outcome related to the position of B1.\n4. \"Place block B1 in special area SA3.\" - The predicted goal is essentially a paraphrase of this instruction.\n\nThe predicted goal is consistent with the outcome described in all the ground truth goals, which is having B1 end up in SA3. The slight differences in phrasing do not affect the outcome.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
