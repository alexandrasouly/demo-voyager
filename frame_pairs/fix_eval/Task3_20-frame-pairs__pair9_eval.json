The predicted goal only mentions picking up B3 from SA3, without specifying what to do with it afterward.\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Ground truth goals specify the final location of B3 (SA1).\n2. The predicted goal specifies the initial action (picking up B3 from SA3) but does not mention the final location.\n3. Without the final location, we cannot determine if the predicted goal would result in the same outcome as the ground truth goals.\n\nThe predicted goal is incomplete as it does not specify the final step of placing B3 into SA1. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(3) Unknown: There is not enough information to determine whether the predicted goal is correct or incorrect without additional information about the intended final location of B3.",
