The ground truth goals all specify moving block B1 to the \"top left corner,\" which is a more precise location.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\n- The first ground truth goal specifies moving the green square block B1 to the top left corner.\n- The second ground truth goal involves moving to the bottom, picking up block B1, and then moving to the top left with block B1 to place it there.\n- The third ground truth goal is to move B1 to the top left corner and then move the agent itself back slightly.\n- The fourth ground truth goal is to place block B1 in the top-left corner of the arena.\n\nThe predicted goal does not match any of the ground truth goals exactly because it lacks the specificity of the \"top left corner.\" Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal might end up placing B1 anywhere along the top edge of the arena, not necessarily in the top left corner.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
