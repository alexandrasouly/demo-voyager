The second part, \"then move back to the middle left edge of the environment,\" is an additional action that does not affect the outcome of B3 being in SA1.\n\n4. \"Move block B3 inside special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal is the same as this ground truth goal.\n\nThe predicted goal matches all the ground truth goals in terms of the outcome of B3 being in SA1. The additional instruction in the third ground truth goal does not change the outcome related to B3's location.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
