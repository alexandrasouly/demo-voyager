The predicted goal states to \"Gather all blocks into SA2,\" which aligns with the intent of moving blocks into SA2 as described in the ground truths.\n\nThe predicted goal does not specify the number of blocks, but it uses the term \"all blocks,\" which would include B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5. Therefore, the predicted goal matches the ground truth goals that mention moving all blocks into SA2 and putting all the blocks inside special area SA2.\n\nThe predicted goal is (2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal, as it would lead to the same outcome of having all blocks in SA2.",
