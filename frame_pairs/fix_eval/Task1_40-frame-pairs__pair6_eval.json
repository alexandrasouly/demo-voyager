The predicted goal only states \"Pick up B1\" without any information about where to move B1 after picking it up.\n\nSince the predicted goal lacks the information about the final location of B1, it is incomplete compared to the ground truth goals. The action of picking up B1 is a part of the ground truth goals, but it is not sufficient on its own to achieve the full goal described in the ground truths.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals. The predicted goal omits the crucial step of moving B1 to the top left, which is necessary for the goal to be completed.",
