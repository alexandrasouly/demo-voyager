    "cot": "The ground truth goals describe a sequence of actions involving the robot and block B1, which includes turning towards the block, moving to the bottom towards it, rotating to nudge it, and facing it. The predicted goal simply states to move the robot to block B1.\n\nThe predicted goal is somewhat aligned with the ground truth goals in that it involves the robot moving towards block B1. However, the ground truth goals specify additional actions such as turning, rotating, and facing the block, which are not mentioned in the predicted goal. The predicted goal's simplicity leaves out these details, which could be significant depending on the context of the task.\n\nGiven the information provided, the predicted goal is not entirely incorrect because it does involve interaction with block B1, which is a part of the ground truth goals. However, it is also not entirely correct because it omits several steps that are specified in the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: The predicted goal is aligned with the ground truth goals in terms of the final object of interaction (block B1) but lacks the specificity of the actions to be taken. An agent following the predicted goal would move towards B1, which is a part of the ground truth goals, but may not perform the additional actions unless those actions are inherently part of moving to B1 in the specific environment, which is not detailed here.",
