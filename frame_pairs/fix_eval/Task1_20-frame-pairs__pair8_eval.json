    "cot": "Let's compare the predicted goal with each ground truth statement:\n\n1. \"Back away from the yellow triangle B1 in the top left corner.\" - The predicted goal involves moving from the top left to the center left and releasing B1 at the top left. This does not necessarily imply backing away from B1, as it could mean the robot is initially holding B1 and then releases it. However, the end result is that the robot is away from B1, which is similar to the ground truth.\n\n2. \"Move to top left and place block B1\" - The predicted goal includes releasing B1 at the top left, which is equivalent to placing B1 at the top left. This matches the ground truth.\n\n3. \"Leave B1 and move back into the center of the arena\" - The predicted goal states moving from the top left to the center left, which is a movement towards the center of the arena after interacting with B1. This is similar to the ground truth.\n\n4. \"Move away from block B1.\" - The predicted goal has the robot moving away from the top left (where B1 is released) to the center left, which aligns with moving away from B1.\n\nThe predicted goal is consistent with the ground truths in terms of the final position of B1 (top left) and the robot's movement away from B1 towards the center of the arena. Therefore, the predicted goal is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
