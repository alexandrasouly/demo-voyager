The outcome is different because the block is not released.\n\n2. \"Move to special area SA1 with block B1 and push block B2 into the special area SA1 and place block B1 into the special area SA1\" - The predicted goal does not mention moving any blocks to SA1 or interacting with blocks B1 or B2. The outcome is different because the blocks are not moved to the specified location.\n\n3. \"Reverse back until level with SA2\" - The predicted goal does not specify reversing or aligning with SA2. The outcome is different because there is no interaction with SA2.\n\n4. \"Release block B1 and move away.\" - The predicted goal does not mention releasing block B1 or moving away from a specific location. The outcome is different because the block is not released.\n\nThe predicted goal does not match any of the ground truth goals in terms of the specific actions to be taken with the blocks or the goal regions. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
