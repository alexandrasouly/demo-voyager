This matches the initial action described in all the ground truth goals, which involve grabbing or picking up B1. However, the ground truth goals specify additional actions after picking up the block, such as moving it towards the bottom, pushing it along the bottom edge to the left, or moving it to the bottom-left corner.\n\nThe predicted goal does not specify what to do with B1 after picking it up. Therefore, it is incomplete when compared to the ground truth goals. However, since picking up B1 is a common initial step in all ground truth goals, the predicted goal could be considered a partial match.\n\nGiven the information provided, the predicted goal is a subgoal that aligns with the initial step of the ground truth goals but does not specify the final position or action with B1. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: The predicted goal is incomplete and does not specify the final desired outcome, which is significant in determining the success of the goal.",
