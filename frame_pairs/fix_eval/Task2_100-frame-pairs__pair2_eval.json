However, since the predicted goal does not contradict the movement of B3, it is still correct regarding B1 and B2.\n\n4. \"Move balls B1 and B2 to special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal matches this statement as it specifies moving B1 and B2 to SA1 without mentioning the shape, which is not necessary as long as the labels are correct.\n\nThe predicted goal matches all the ground truth goals in terms of the outcome for B1 and B2. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
