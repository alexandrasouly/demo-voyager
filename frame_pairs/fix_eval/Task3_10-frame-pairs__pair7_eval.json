The predicted goal only mentions moving the robot (R) to block B2, without any further instruction on what to do with the block or where to move it.\n\nSince the predicted goal does not mention pushing the blocks towards SA2, nor does it include all the blocks mentioned in the ground truth (B1, B2, and B5), it does not match any of the ground truth goals in terms of the final outcome. The predicted goal is focused solely on the robot's movement to a block, not on the action with the blocks or the target location (SA2).\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals. The predicted goal does not lead to the same outcome as the ground truth goals.",
