However, the predicted goal adds an additional action: \"introduce B2 to SA3.\" This action involving B2 is not mentioned in any of the ground truth goals.\n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is partially correct in that it includes the action of moving B1 to SA3, but it also includes an additional action that is not part of the ground truth goals. This additional action would lead to a different outcome than what is described in the ground truth.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals, specifically the introduction of B2 to SA3 which is not part of the ground truth.",
