    "cot": "The predicted goal is to \"Move B1 to the top left of the arena.\"\n\nComparing this with the ground truth goals:\n\n1. \"Move the pink triangle block B1 to the top left corner.\" - The predicted goal matches this description, as both specify moving B1 to the top left corner/area.\n\n2. \"Move to top left with block B1 and place it at top left\" - The predicted goal is consistent with this statement, as both involve moving B1 to the top left and placing it there.\n\n3. \"Grab B1, move it to the left edge & almost to the top, then release it and move back a little\" - The predicted goal aligns with the action of moving B1 to the top left, although it does not specify the additional action of moving back a little. However, this additional action does not change the outcome regarding the location of B1.\n\n4. \"Place block B1 in the top-left corner of the arena.\" - The predicted goal is in agreement with this statement, as both direct for B1 to be placed in the top-left corner.\n\nThe predicted goal is consistent with all the ground truth goals in terms of the final outcome, which is having B1 in the top left of the arena. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
