Despite slight variations in wording, such as \"inside,\" \"to,\" \"into,\" and \"in,\" all descriptions are consistent in the outcome they describe: block B2 should end up in SA1.\n\nThe only additional detail in one of the ground truth goals is the instruction to \"reverse back towards SA2\" after pushing B2 into SA1. However, this action does not change the outcome related to the position of block B2; it only specifies an additional action for the robot after the block has been placed.\n\nSince the predicted goal matches the outcome of all the ground truth goals, which is to have block B2 in SA1, the predicted goal is correct. The additional reversing instruction does not affect the correctness of the predicted goal in terms of the final position of block B2.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
