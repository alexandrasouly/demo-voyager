The predicted goal only mentions moving one block (B4) to SA1.\n\nComparing the predicted goal to each ground truth goal:\n\n1. The first ground truth goal specifies pushing blocks B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 into SA1. The predicted goal only mentions moving B4 to SA1, which is a subset of the first ground truth goal.\n2. The second ground truth goal is similar to the first, asking to place blocks B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 into SA1. Again, the predicted goal only addresses B4.\n3. The third ground truth goal is different in that it specifies SA3 instead of SA1. The predicted goal does not match this ground truth goal.\n4. The fourth ground truth goal is to move all the blocks to SA1, which includes B4.\n\nThe predicted goal is a partial match to the ground truth goals that specify moving blocks to SA1. However, since it does not include all the blocks mentioned in the ground truths, the predicted goal would not lead to the same outcome as described in the ground truths. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
