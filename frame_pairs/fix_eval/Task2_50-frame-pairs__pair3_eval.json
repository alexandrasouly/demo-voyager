However, since the main goal is to move B3 to SA1, the predicted goal is still correct in terms of the outcome.\n\n4. \"Move block B3 to special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal is a direct match for this statement.\n\nSince the predicted goal matches the outcome of moving B3 to SA1 as described in all the ground truth statements, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
