The second part of moving back is not mentioned, but since the predicted goal does not contradict the final position of B1, it is still correct.\n\n4. \"Place block B1 in the top-left corner of the arena.\" - The predicted goal is consistent with this statement as it describes the same final position for B1.\n\nSince the predicted goal matches all the ground truth goals in terms of the final position of B1, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
