The predicted goal states that the robot (R) should move to the top left while carrying B1. \n\nBoth the ground truths and the predicted goal involve moving B1 to the top left corner, and the predicted goal explicitly mentions that the robot is carrying B1, which is necessary for the block to be moved. \n\nTherefore, the predicted goal is in line with the ground truth goals, and the agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
