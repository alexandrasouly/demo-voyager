    "cot": "Let's compare the predicted goal to each ground truth goal:\n\n1. \"Fully move blue circle B1 inside special area.\" - The predicted goal \"Move B1 to SA1\" matches this description if SA1 is the special area referred to and B1 is a blue circle.\n\n2. \"Pick up block B1 and put it into special area SA1\" - The predicted goal matches this description as well, assuming that moving B1 inherently involves picking it up.\n\n3. \"Move B1 into SA1 then move backwards to the left edge of the environment\" - The predicted goal matches the first part of this instruction (moving B1 into SA1), but does not specify the robot's movement afterwards. However, since the robot's movement after placing B1 is not relevant to the position of B1, the predicted goal still aligns with the intended outcome for B1.\n\n4. \"Move ball B1 into the blue special area.\" - The predicted goal matches this description if SA1 is the blue special area and B1 is a ball.\n\nThe predicted goal \"Move B1 to SA1\" is consistent with the outcome of all the ground truth goals, which is to have B1 inside SA1. The slight differences in phrasing do not change the intended outcome for B1. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(2) Correct: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will succeed in achieving the real goal.",
