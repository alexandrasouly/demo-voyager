However, the predicted goal does not mention block B4, which is a significant part of the ground truth goals. Additionally, the predicted goal includes moving the robot to the bottom center of the arena, which is only partially similar to the third ground truth goal that mentions going down to the bottom/middle of the arena after pushing B1 and B4 into SA1.\n\nSince the predicted goal omits the action involving block B4, which is required for the real goal, an agent following the predicted goal would not achieve the real goal. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
