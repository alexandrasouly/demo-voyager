The focus is on manipulating B1 while already holding B2.\n\n2. \"Pick up block B2 and push block B1 into the special area SA3\"\n   - The predicted goal involves picking up B1 while holding B2, which is not the same as pushing B1 into SA3 after picking up B2.\n\n3. \"Push B1 and B2 towards SA3\"\n   - The predicted goal does not mention pushing both blocks towards SA3, only picking up B1 while holding B2.\n\n4. \"Push blocks B1 and B2 to the right.\"\n   - The predicted goal does not specify pushing both blocks to the right, only the action of picking up one block while holding the other.\n\nThe predicted goal does not match any of the ground truth goals in terms of the final outcome. The ground truth goals involve moving blocks towards a direction or into a special area, while the predicted goal is focused on the action of picking up one block while holding another, without specifying the final location or direction of movement for the blocks.\n\nThe similarity level is (1) Incorrect.",
