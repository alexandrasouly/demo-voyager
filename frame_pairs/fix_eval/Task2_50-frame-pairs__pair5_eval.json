    "cot": "Let's compare the predicted goal with each ground truth goal:\n\n1. \"Move blue circle B1 fully inside special area SA1.\" - The predicted goal \"Move B1 into SA1\" matches this description, as it does not contradict any part of the ground truth. The color and shape are not mentioned in the prediction, but the label B1 is correct, and the action of moving it into SA1 is the same.\n\n2. \"Move to top left to pick up block B1 and move to special area SA1 with block B1 and place it into special area\" - The predicted goal is less specific about the starting position and the action of picking up, but the end result of moving B1 into SA1 is the same.\n\n3. \"Push B1 a little to the right so that it's in SA1, then move backwards to the left edge of the environment\" - The predicted goal aligns with the first part of this ground truth, which is moving B1 into SA1. The second part of the ground truth about moving backwards is not contradicted by the prediction, as it does not specify what happens after B1 is moved.\n\n4. \"Move ball B1 fully inside the blue special area.\" - The predicted goal is in agreement with this ground truth as well, as it specifies moving B1 into SA1 without contradicting any details about the color or the shape.\n\nThe predicted goal is correct because it would lead to the same outcome as all the ground truth descriptions, even though it is less specific. The key elements of moving B1 into SA1 are present in both the predicted and ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is (2) Correct.",
