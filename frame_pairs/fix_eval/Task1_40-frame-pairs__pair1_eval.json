The predicted goal only states \"Pick up B1\" without specifying where to move it afterward.\n\nSince the predicted goal does not include the final location for B1, it is incomplete when compared to the ground truth goals. An agent following the predicted goal would only achieve part of the real goal, which is picking up B1, but would not necessarily move it to the top left corner as required.\n\nTherefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals. The predicted goal omits the crucial step of moving B1 to the specified location.",
