For each task, we provide:
1. selected frame pairs n frames apart, n ={10, 20, .. len(traj)/2, len(traj)}
2. 10 whole trajectories with every frame. This is useful for prompting that uses multiple pairs of frames to produce subsequent
subgoals at the same time, or trying to determine the high-level goal based on subsequent subgoals.

The frames are selected semi-randomly from the trajectories: the end of the trajectories is often just idling, so we avoid including frames 
where there is no significant movement between frames

In each folder, there is a <evaluator_name>.txt file describing what a human might say the subgoals/sequence of subgoals are.

Task1: MoveToCorner - 80 frames long

10 frame pairs:
    - 10 frames apart
    - 20 frames apart
    - 40 frames apart
    - 80 frames apart

Task2: FindDupe - 100 frames long

10 frame pairs:
    - 10 frames apart (I think this is too little most of the time)
    - 20 frames apart
    - 50 frames apart
    - 100 frames apart

Task3: PushToRed - 180 frames long
10 frame pairs:
    - 10 frames apart (I think this is too little most of the time)
    - 20 frames apart
    - 40 frames apart
    - 60 frames apart
    - 180 frames apart
